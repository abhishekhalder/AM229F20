    "# Supplying toilet papers to Walmart stores\n",

    "Suppose you are the distribution manager overseeing all the Walmart gorcery stores in California. There are $m$ factories producing toilet papers in the region, which need to be supplied to $n$ Walmart stores in the state.\n",

    "The geographic locations (latitudes and longitudes) of the factories and stores: $x_{i}^{\\text{factory}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $x_{j}^{\\text{store}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ are known, for all $i=1,...,m$, and $j=1,...,n$. At present, Walmart uses its own trucks for this delivery which incur $C_{ij}$ dollars (for fuel cost, travel time etc.) to transport **per unit mass of toilet paper** from the $i$th factory to the $j$th store. A reasonable model is that $C_{ij}$ equals to the squared Euclidean distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_{ij} = \\|x_{i}^{\\text{factory}} - x_{j}^{\\text{store}}\\|_{2}^{2}, \\quad\\forall\\;(i,j)\\in\\{1,...,m\\}\\times\\{1,...,n\\}.$$\n",

    "This defines a cost matrix $C \\equiv [C_{ij}]$ of size $m\\times n$. The $i$th factory has a fixed (normalized) production capacity $\\alpha_{i}>0$. The $j$th store has a fixed (normalized) storage capacity $\\beta_{j}>0$. Here \"normalized\" means that $\\sum_{i}\\alpha_{i}=\\sum_{j}\\beta_{j}=1$. Toilet papers cannot be stored elsewhere, i.e., all the toilet papers produced must be supplied to the stores."
